_This is an article that I originally wrote for my Wordpress site but have moved here._

It is honestly hard to believe we are five weeks into our coding bootcamp. So two quick things: This will be the typical blog of reflecting on this past week. I mentioned in a previous post that I would write an article on the process of choosing a bootcamp as well as an article on reflecting on the bootcamp so far. I plan to have those done this week and scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday.

Week 5 Review

This week we began learning backend, and in a small way, we are now able to do full-stack applications. Meaning we can implement web applications using both front-end and back-end technologies.

We did this primarily by installing some software that enables us to create our own databases and have api calls to our databases that are then able to be rendered on screen.

So we began creating a blog. Why a blog? A blog shows, on a basic level, that we are able to implement what is necessary for a website to work. We can make our server and create our database that our front-end is able to make calls to and therefore display the information on screen. Specifically for different users we can display their blog and then create more blogs for that user and delete them. We still have a good ways to go on begin able to edit the blog and use authorization and authentication, which we will learn next week, week 6.

By the end of week 6 we will be able to call from databases using Sql and Mongo and other databases as well as implement authorization and authentication for the blog site (we call our Rockbottom blog since we are at rockbottom of our coding journey, feel free to laugh here. There needs to be some way of styling text to indicate laughter when being sarcastic).

After that we will move on to React and then Material UI, and we as a class are counting down the days until we get to use those things. We are doing the work now in the most difficult way SO THAT when we get to those things we know more of what we are doing and can adapt quickly.

This week was a refreshing week after functional programming last week.

So, look for those two blogs I mentioned on Wednesday and Thursday.

Til next time,

â€“ Ben
