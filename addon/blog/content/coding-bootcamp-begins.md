_This is an article that I originally wrote for my Wordpress site but have moved here._

I started a new thing on August 3rd. So consider this a journal of sorts.

I started coding bootcamp with Jack Russell Coding School. I had been waiting for this for months to start a coding bootcamp so it is no surprise that I am late on this blog. I will detail the process of settling on a bootcamp in a later blog.

As is the nature of a bootcamp, from what I hear, we were welcomed to the class and began learning code immediately. This bootcamp is teaching us to be Full-stack Web Developers. That does mean something but I will define it later.

We started with HTML. Whether it is important or not to you, dear reader, html stands for “hyper text mark-up language.” The best way to think of html is like writing a word document that is housed on the inter-webs. A word doc. is formatted uniquely, therefore a html file must be formatted in a specific way. Here is a sample document and the boiler-plate (necessary formatting) for it.

_\*I took out the boiler plate info here._

If that looks strange, it is ok. This is just basic and necessary code for beginning an html document. HTML feels very like writing a word doc meaning it can feel very tedious for very little reward. That does all change but it will take time to learn the other code to make it all look nice.

Point is, learning to code, even though I had done a far amount of coding before, is challenging.

The next blog I will get into CSS.
