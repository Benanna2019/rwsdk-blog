Every now and again, when you are doing some sort of challenge, things happen and you have to go for low hanging fruit.

This advent season I have been trying to do the blogvent thing on bsky. The idea is to write a post a day. 

Today's is just something I have noticed recently. There are always things where you know you should be doing it and you don't realize the effect of it until things go poorly. For me recently this has been drinking water and sleep. 

First my poor habits. I don't like water and rarely drink it. Recently I have just been trying to drink the recommended amount of water per day which is half your body weight in ounces of water. So if I am 230lbs, I should be drinking 115oz of water per day. The reality is both as grim and better than I thought. I feel much better but dang it you do pee so much. 

The other thing is sleep. I am a terrible sleeper. If I get woken up it takes forever to go back to sleep so I only wake up when its needed, like my 9 month old needs to be fed, or something. 

So I usually sleep with ear buds in and I have gotten into a terrible habit of feeling I need to listen to something to sleep. And I am not talking about good white noise or the sleep noises. I am talking about podcasts or whatever. This has just led to terrible sleep and I believe today it hit a peak for me. My head feels like it will explode and I fell asleep in the office (in a lounge area). 

So my point is, don't be like me. Get better sleep. And you can join me in committing to habits that we know are good and will make us better. 

Also, sorry for a non technical post that is somewhat cheesy. I just needed to get a post out today.
