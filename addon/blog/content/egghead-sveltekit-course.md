After 2 years of on, off, nights, weekends, throwing it all away and restarting, breaking api changes, and much more, my [SvelteKit course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-sanity-cms-powered-sveltekit-blog-a15d9e1f?af=5w7fzz) has finally launched on [egghead](https://egghead.io)

If you have questions please don't hesitate to ask in the comments here!

I could not be more excited about launching this course.
