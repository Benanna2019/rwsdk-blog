This is just a quick post after a day of reflection. 

First, I have never had to go to the doctor for migraines. Turns out I had some sort of viral thing or infection. Headaches cripple me so I have been trying to figure this out for a few days. 

Sometimes the things that work are getting help. But in the meantime, I have been adopting better habits such as drinking the right amount of water and getting more sleep and exercising. 

That may seem random but it kind of serves as a backdrop for the rest of the day. Inevitably I come to this place every few months where I am just tired of everything. Things I was excited about have no flavor. And at the end of thinking everything is vanity, I am reminded that almost all the things that people are doing who are having some semblance of a life I would like to work towards are things I already know I need to be doing. (please know that statement is very high level. I love my life and family. But professionally there are things I want to do that I never seem to get around to doing).

Alex Hillman and Amy Hoy are where I turn for this. 

But to be honest I am struggling. I don't know what is to stop this time from turning into the same as all the other times. Some kick of motivation where I am tired of it all and "I am going to do things right this time", only to not do it and not follow through.

Would be nice to have people I am accountable to but I don't know if that will work. 

So I am just trying from now on to do things I know to work. Even if I don't know they do, most of the time I follow someone or buy a course to follow a proven path, I make it a couple days in and then don't finish so it has "never worked". 

I should probably think more on this but just wanted to think out loud a little about the things I want to start focusing on. But I have wanted to do this before and yet here I am. 

So...
