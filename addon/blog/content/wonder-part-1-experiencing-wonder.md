Thanksgiving is over. The holiday season is now in full swing. The holidays are experienced in many different ways be every person. Yesterday, Sunday, the pastor of the church I attend made an observation about Christmas movies and the holiday season in particular. He said, "All Christmas movies have that singular moment in them where they try to capture wonder."

As I have thought about that statement, I do believe he is correct. Whether you love or hate this season I believe it has to do with wonder. If you love it, most likely this season brings with it a sense of wonder that you remember and long for again and again. If you do not like this season, is it because it has lost its sense of wonder? That something happened and things are not the way they are supposed to be?

More personally, I love Christmas. My wife and I love this season. She is a phenomenal gift giver and wonder is reflected through her as she gives others thoughtful gifts. I enjoy the general joy and wonder that comes with the season, even though it is a very consumeristic time of year. Christmas is also a rhythm where we get to reflect for an extended period of time on the wonder of God and what he has done for us.

Wonder and beauty carry with them a sense of awe that we seldom feel anymore. I have not been to the grand canyon but everyone who has shares how awesome/aweful (being full of awe) the experience was. Whether they loved it and were blown away or hated it because of how small it made them feel, they experience awe all the same.

We love wonder and yet at the same time many of us are left frustrated by experiences of wonder. Why? My simple analysis is this: Wonder is not practical. What am I supposed to do with wonder? If I cannot go and use it for something what good is it?

- **It is wonder and experiences that leave us silent that are our greatest experiences in life.**

What if the point of wonder is to just sit? What if you are not meant to use it for something? What if silence from being filled with awe causes you to reflect on the good things in life?

Wonder says to you, "Hey, I know things are crazy but remember how big this world is." For the Christian, wonder says, "Hey, I know things are crazy and feel out of your control, but remember how big and awesome God is. This experience of feeling small is good. You get to see how big God is and know that God cares for you as his own child."

- **Wonder turns our eyes off of us and causes us to see grandeur which can have a horrifyingly awesome impact on our lives.**

How have you experienced wonder?
