Somewhat piggybacking off of yesterday's entry, I have been thinking about what holds us back from starting something new or some creative pursuit. 

I really don't like the phrase "imposter syndrome" anymore. Like all things it kinda starts off as a legitimate thing and then it becomes a trendy thing that everyone experiences. But everyone does experience it in some way but I don't like the hip nature that comes with identifying with it. 

Regardless, something I have started to notice is that there are people who don't seem to have this problem and many of them are not people I want to follow. But it is interesting that there are a lot of people who are doing creative things and don't have any sort of being an imposter and then there are those with expertise who probably should be pursuing a creative endeavor and they don't due to this fear. 

I don't know what it will take for me, or you if you struggle with this, to start but I think it is worth finding something, whatever it is, that gets pulls you out of a rut and is something like a familiar friend reminding you to get started. 

If you listen to anyone who is successful, anyone, at what they are doing in their creative expression, the one thing you will always hear is that you just have to start. People I don't particularly like can be the best motivational coach when the "how do I get started" question comes up. 

Most of us want to know what we should do and that it will work. And often times we don't get an answer for either of those but we know that if we don't do anything we still not know what to do and it therefore won't work. 

So at the end of it all if you don't just do something, you won't get there, ever. If I don't, I won't get there. So I don't know all I will get done or get to in 2025 but there are certain things I know that if I don't do them it is for all the reasons above. Youtube is one of those things. 

Anyways, I am working on the things I want to do in 2025 and especially those things that I think I would enjoy but have yet to start due to the above fears.
